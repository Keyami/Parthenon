# Register your merchant existence conditions here
# They're valid for specific merchants (defined by conditions) or all marchants
# They're periodically checked and merchants that don't match it are destroyed ; they're also checked when trying to create a merchant or add a shop to it

  # 'example_disallow_spawn' is the name of the conditions
  # In this example merchants in the spawn region will be forbidden

#    # Here if the condition is valid, that means the merchant is in the spawn region ; so we need the condition to be not valid
