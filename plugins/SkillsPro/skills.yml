# Activation keys can be: L = Left-click, R = Right-click, S = Shift, Q = Drop Item, F = Switch Item, C<key> = While Sneaking
# For example activation key for an ability is "LRQFFCQ" -> left-click, right-click, drop item, switch item two times, drop item while sneaking.
# F (switch items) works with no item in hand as well, however R (right-click) won't work if you're not holding an item,
# but it works if you right-click on a block with empty hands.
# For C<key> (while sneaking) option you don't need to sneak at that exact order. You can be sneaking the whole time while doing the other keys.
# But that's different for S (Shift, Sneak) key. It maintains its order. Combinations such as "CS", "SC" or "CC" don't make sense, they're basically "S"
# Time between each key press can be configured in config.yml
# The combination is unlimited but it's recommended to keep a short script.
# Also note that if a skill has multiple active abilities, expressions such as "SSL" and "SSLS" for two abilities in a single skill are not allowed.
# Since "SSL" ability will be activated before "SSLS" ability.

# Activation items are optional.
# To activate the ability with any item or even without any, use '*'
# If an item's name is specified, it'll check if the current item's name contains this name or not.
# E.g. item: BOW -> CROSSBOW, BOW | item: SWORD -> DIAMOND_SWORD, WOODEN_SWORD, GOLDEN_SWORD, etc...
# https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/bukkit/org/bukkit/Material.html (tip: use Ctrl+F to find the material you want)

# Commands support arguments, the command can either be executed from the player or the console.
# Supports all the placeholders.
# E.g.
# commands-to-perform-upon-select:
# - PLAYER:spawn
# - CONSOLE:give %player% 0 %skills_level% DEAD_BUSH

# Health is the the player's max health.
# Max-health is the maximum value of the health value.
# Note that these values are decimals. 1 means half a heart.
# So if you want to have 20 whole hearts you need to put 40

# Energy is the energy type the skill uses.
# The energy name must be the node name.

# You can also add these properties to any active ability:
# messages:
#  idle: When player ability is activated but isn't used.
#  activated: When ability is activated.
#  finished: When ability is finished. Mostly for abilities that are not activated instantly.
#  ready: When a non-instant ability is activated and waiting for response.

# Placeholders in the GUI for normal scaling is %amount%
# Other scalings have the placeholder with their own name.
# For example "chance" scaling placeholder is %chance%
# These scalings will be colored if a stat is specified in their
# formula with the stat color defined in the config.
# Scalings that use dynamic numbers such as "damage" or "durability"
# placeholders will not be displayed as numbers but will show the formula itself,
# since the program can't predict those dynamic values.

# Scaling variables:
# lvl - The level of the current ability. If this is used outside of abilities section, it refers to the level of skill.
# Placeholders for Stats are their node name case-sensitive. You just need the node name not %skills_stat_<node>% however you can use that as well.
# And supports all the placeholders.
# Note do not use placeholders in scaling that define the placeholder itself or you will get StackOverflowError.
# For example you can't use %skills_max_energy% in "max-energy" scaling.
# However there are special variables for certain scalings and they're marked with a comment.
# Chance scalings have min value of 0 and maximum value of 100
# Most of the scalings have a special placeholder "damage"
# All the math operations are accepted.
# +-^*/() sqrt(num) round(num) floor(num) log(num) cos(num) etc...
# You can see a full list from Java's Math class: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Math.html
# Special cases: random(min, max) will give you a double and there is randInt(min, max) that gives an integer.
