# GUIs have a lot of custom options you can use.
# All the options that support strings also support placeholders.
# First the settings for GUI itself are:
# title: The title of the GUI.
# rows: The rows of a chest GUI.
# type: If no rows is specified, then a GUI type is used.
# sound: The sound played when the GUI is opened.
# commands: [string] A list of commands executed when the GUI is opened.
# interactableSlots: [integers] A list of slot positions that can be interacted with. Interactable slots are slots that any
# items placed in that slot can be taken or a new item can be put:

# Options for each GUI item (option):
# The name of the option is optional, but in special cases these names are used to execute a code.
# For example all the options named with the skill name should be kept like that. Only the option name of the few glass options at the end can be changed.
# name: The name of the item.
# material: The material of the item. You can get a list here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/Material.html
# lore: [] A list of strings for item lore. Lores support line breaks \n and they'll even keep their previous color from the last line!
# unbreakable: true/false if the item should be unbreakable.
# commands: [string] A list of commands executed when item is clicked.
# sound: The sound to play when item is clicked.
# can-take: true/false if this item can be taken. But no item can be placed after that. To do that set the slot as an interactable slot in the GUI option.
# posx, posy, slot, slots: Set the position of the item in the GUI. posx and posy should be used together or use the raw slot number with "slot" and place the item in multiple
# slots using "slots: [numbers]"
# click: Click type. If none is specified default is left-click. You can get a list here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/event/inventory/ClickType.html
# flags: [] A list of item flags. You can get a list here: https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/org/bukkit/inventory/ItemFlag.html

# Other than the normal options for items such as name, material and lore, there are a lot of other options.
# amount, damage, enchants, model-data, attributes and etc...
# A popular one is "skull" You need to set the material as PLAYER_HEAD for this to work.
# The skull property allows one of the following values: Player Name, Minecraft Textures URL, Base64 (value signature)
# Using the base64 value is always better since it doesn't need caching or connecting to Mojang for the texture.
# You can find custom heads in websites like https://minecraft-heads.com
